# my-first-go-project

**initial commit:**

tried to develop a go project with mock people data (needs database in further phases)

displayed data as plain text (which is not preferred)

used go's built-in http commands (framework usage will be better for sure)

no database connection, no json usage (not preferred, again)

project displays each person's descriptive data when id is given in the url

id is getting parsed from url in '?id=' format (which is not preferred too)
